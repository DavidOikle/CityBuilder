# City Builder Overview
A city builder based JS web game

Taking what i've learned from previous projects, the goal for this project is to create a city builder style game, and mesh that with my art. I've been wanting to get into landscape painting for awhile now, so this seems like a great way to do it!

# Gameplay

The game revolves around the player managing a city, attemtping to achive one of a number of goals in order to solidify that city's place in history. This can include things like becoming a center for learning and arts/culture, forging an economic powerhouse, or establishing a haven for the lives of the everyday indivudual in the city. 

Broadly, the game will be turned based, where every turn the player is able to choose a limited number of actions to take. Each turn will also present the player with a random event, with the events being influenced by a combination of the player's previous actions, but also somewhat random events that are out of the player's control.

Example:

A storm has sweeped through your city, with the ports taking the worst of the damage, what should be the focus for recovery?
A: Rebuild the ports just as it was before. Cost = 100
B: Develop protections for the ports during the rebuild. Cost = 200, Prosperity +1
C: The ports must fend for themselves, the resources are needed elsewhere. Cost = 50, prosperity -1

The other half of each turn will be managing of a city. This can be to enact, support/fund, scrap, or otherwise interact with various factors that influence the city.

Boosting the access to healthcare in the city will help prosperity levels rise, but it takes time and resources to do so. Will you raise taxes to pay for your city's 

# Inspirations

Inspirations for this include but are not limited to titles such as King of Dragon Pass, Paradox grand stategy games (In partciular the Victoria games), the Civilization series, Reigns, and my own personal experinces of going through life, spending my youth in a smaller country town, moving to a medium sized city (halifax), and now living in a large metropolitan center (Toronto).

# Considerations

NO COMBAT:
I'm challenging myself to not have any sort of direct combat. Conflict can arise in many ways, it doesnt have to be a matter of subjigating or eliminating others. A goal of this project will be to think of conflict in ways that dont involve direct fighting. While the player will posses a nominal secutiy force, (the focus of which can be up to the player) the goal is to limit that so the player has to think about it as something other than a cudgel for being an aggressor.

At the end of the day, youre running a city, and the focus should be on the city, and more importantly the people living in it. A token security force to protect a city from outside actors, or to provide distater relief is one thing, providing infinte funding to said security force so they can be used to suprress one's citizens and such is a very different one.

Army vs militia vs whatever
IF a military can't be used to invade others, what does it do? 

The world still exists, outside actors can still act aganist you. So you need to have some sort of means of protecting yourself. Tribute? Self defense force? What do they do in peace time? An established military will want to be used (either the inviduvual troops within it, or more likely the powers that be running it) as it will want to make itself seem justified to be used. What if the focus of a group was for disaster relief, 

# Gameplay Contd

As noted before, the broad idea is to lead your city to success. THis can come in the following forms, represented by abstract meters. Currently the exact end goal is being brainstormed, however the current goal will be just to get one of the following to a score of 100, while avoiding hitting a score of -100 in any other meter. Hitting 100 with any of these will result in a win, while hitting -100 will result in a loss.

1: Arts and culture. Your city has become a hub for the arts, a center for learning and knowlede, or a seat of power with its cultural exports. 

2: Economic. Either through trade or production, you are a force to be reckoned with. Do you have a monopoly on a valuable resource? Are your docks among the largest in the world, diverting trade wherever possible?

3: Happiness: People flock to your city due to stories being told of how wonderful life is there. Healthcare, econimic stability, secuity from outside actors; these are but a few of the things the average citizen is thinking of on a daily basis.
